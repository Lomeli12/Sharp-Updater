Sharp-Updater
=============
_By Anthony Lomeli_

## Some News for Linux users:

Sharp-Updater-Linux is now avaliable. It works exactly the same as the Windows version, with a few exceptions:

1. Has a "Check for Updates" button(IDK how to get to check on loading)
2. Progress bar is there, but not working at this moment
3. You'll need [MonoDevelop](http://monodevelop.com/) and [GTK#](http://www.mono-project.com/GtkSharp) to compile from source

Other than that, it uses the same XML Files and Nodes as the Windows version. So, have fun!
